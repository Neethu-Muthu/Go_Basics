# Golang Basic Programs 🚀

Welcome to the **Golang Basic Programs** repository! This collection is designed to introduce **beginners** to the fundamentals of the **Go programming language**. Whether you are new to Go or programming in general, this repository contains simple and effective examples to get you started. It covers everything from basic arithmetic operations to understanding **variables**, **constants**, and **identifiers**.

Each program is written in a separate file, and there's a common `main.go` file that serves as an entry point to execute them all.
