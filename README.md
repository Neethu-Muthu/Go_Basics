# Golang Basic Programs

Welcome to the **Golang Basic Programs** repository! This collection of programs is designed to introduce beginners to the fundamentals of the **Go programming language**. From basic arithmetic operations to understanding variables, constants, and identifiers, this repository has a wide range of examples that will help you get comfortable with Go's syntax and features.

Each program is written in a separate file, with a common `main.go` file that serves as an entry point for execution.

## Programs Included:

### 1. **Addition**
A simple program to add two numbers and display the result.

### 2. **Subtraction**
A program that demonstrates how to subtract one number from another.

### 3. **Variables**
Learn how to declare and use variables in Go.

### 4. **Constants**
Shows how to define and use constants, which have fixed values during the program's execution.

### 5. **Identifiers**
Demonstrates the use of valid and invalid identifiers in Go.

## Project Structure:

- `main.go`: The entry point for all programs (can be used to run or test specific functions).
- `add.go`: Contains the code to add two numbers.
- `subtract.go`: Contains the code to subtract numbers.
- `variable.go`: Explains the use of variables in Go.
- `constant.go`: Shows how constants are declared and used.
- `identifier.go`: Explains identifiers and naming conventions in Go.
